Bipolar Disorder is a highly genetic disorder, classified by alternating back and forth between states of mania and depression. These states may last days, or they may last months. Everyone experiences Bipolar Disorder in different ways and to different strengths, but these are just some of the effects you may find yourself feeling. </p><p><b>Mania - </b><span>Mania is when you own the entire planet. Ideas race through your head, anything and everything becomes possible, and everything is interesting. Your confidence is out of this world. You want to accomplish everything - and you'll destroy everything to stand in your way. You become easily frustrated with people or situations, and you find mind racing whenever you try to sleep. You may find yourself overwhelmed with emotion and acting out irrationally or without control.</span></p><p><b>Depression - </b><span>Depression is when you run out of steam. The ideas stop flowing, nothing is possible, and nothing is interesting. Your confidence is at an all time low. Any accomplishment you once cared about is meaningless - and you feel as though there is a mountain standing in your way. You find it hard to interact with people or situations, and you just want to crawl back into a cave. You again find yourself overwhelmed with emotion and acting out irrationally or without control. Where a person with clinical depression might contemplate suicide and then attempt, you may have a spike of depression followed by an attempt, and the whole experience might be over in a matter of seconds or minutes.</span></p></div></md-tab-body></md-tab><md-tab label="Treatment"><md-tab-body><div class="padding-standard"><p>In order to manage these two states, you may find yourself abusing certain vices, like drugs, alcohol, or sex. I have heard from several people with bipolar disorder that they use narcotics or marijuana to help treat manic states, and use uppers or stimulants to help treat depressive states.</p><p>While vices might appear to be the easy fix, it comes with a cost. They can lead to the dangerous side effects of addiction, withdrawal, and tolerance. These vices only treat the symptoms - we must treat the cause in order to truly improve.</p><p>The main approaches I used for treating my BD were support groups, medication, daily checkins, and establishing healthier coping strategies. </p><h4>Support Groups</h4><p> </p><h4>Medication</h4><p>The thought of medication terrified me. My mom was injured in a serious car accident, and so I've had to see her balance a chemical cocktail to manage all her health issues. The idea of taking medication was what made me confront my own mortality and my own weaknesses. I would have to admit my BD to my doctor, my family, my friends, etc. So I kept fighting through the misery. It wasn't until I had my perspective reframed in a support group that I finally gave into the idea of taking medication.</p><b>Taking your medication is the easiest thing you can do.</b><p>You can go to support groups, you can pour out all your emotions, you can try your hardest to wrestle the symptoms, but there will never be anything easier than taking medication. So what are the steps of getting on medication?</p><p><b>1. Talk to your doctor</b><span>&nbsp;Explain what you have been feeling and that you suspect you might have BD. From there, they can either prescribe you treatment or refer you to a psychiatrist. There are two main medications prescribed to treat BD: anti-depressants and mood stabilizers. I'm a very math-brained person so graphs are how I like to think of the effects of each medication. Your mood state will naturally oscillate back in forth from BD and life events. </span></p><b>Anti-depressants</b><img/><p><small>Anti-depressants will overall improve your lows, but does not impact the amplitude of mood states.</small></p><b>Mood-stabilizers</b><img/><p> <small>Mood-stabilizers do not improve your lows, but will reduce the amplitude of your mood states.</small></p><p><b>2. Create a schedule of taking medication consistently</b><span>This may sound absolutely stupid but it could not be more important. Both mood-stabilizers and anti-depressants will only work if they are taken consistently. There are two different lines of thinking that interfere with consistently taking medication. </span></p><p>One of the most common tendencies among people with bipolar disorder is to reach the hypo-manic mood state and decide "I feel good now, so I should be able to stop taking my meds." Part of the reason why you feel good is because the meds are working! This is the most crucial time to continue taking your medication.</p><p>The second line of thought to interfere is when we get swept up into our lives. The big test coming up, the important project at work, taking care of a loved one. Medication gets pushed to the bottom of our to-do list, but again, this is the most crucial time to take your medication.</p><p>You will need to establish your own mechanism of consistently taking medication, and this may take some trial and error. Through support groups, I have heard of people having success with writing on your bathroom mirror "TAKE YOUR MEDS". I tried this method but eventually I stopped reading it because it just blended into the environment. Another strategy I've heard is putting your pills right next to other items that you use everyday (deodorant, toothbrush, hair dryer, etc.) I tried this for a while, but I live with a cat, so my pill bottle would end up on the floor and I would completely forget about it. </p><p>Instead of getting frustrated at myself, I decided I needed to just change up my strategy. The core issue was that I would only realize after leaving the house that I forgot to take my meds, so rather than rely on some memory mechanism, I just started taking my meds with me everywhere I go. I just throw them in the front pocket of my backpack. I realize around lunchtime "oh yeah, I forgot to take my meds," and simply take care of it there. This strategy works for me, but you might need to adapt to your own problem. Here are a few methods you could try and see what works for you:</p><ul class="padding-standard"><li>Creating an alarm on your cellphone with a memo</li><li>Download a specialized app to remind you</li><li>Using a pillbox ahead of time to distribute out dosages</li><li>Having a friend or family member give you a daily reminder</li></ul><p><b>3. Be ready to tweak as necessary&nbsp;</b><span>Medication affects everyone differently, and sometimes takes weeks or even months to act in full effect. Maybe after several months on one mood-stabilzer, you still find yourself still having intense mood states. This just means you will need to talk to your doctor so that they can adjust your dosage or change your medication.&nbsp;</span><span><b>Do not self-adjust your dosage or medication, especially based what you ahve read or what a non-medical professional has told you.&nbsp;</b></span><span>Your doctor will have far more experience and you can ruin months of progress.</span></p></div></md-tab-body></md-tab><md-tab label="Friends &amp; Family"><md-tab-content><p>EYAEWHTWAET</p></md-tab-content></md-tab><md-tab label="Resources"><md-content><p>BOOPERWOOPER</p></md-content></md-tab></md-tabs>
