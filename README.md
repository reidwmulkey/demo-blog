This project is a demo-blog I created. The UI uses bootstrap and jQuery, bower and NPM for managing dependencies, gulp to run build tasks, and Node to serve the content. In order to install and host this blog, you need to first install node from here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After installing node, you will need to install the node modules, bower, and the bower modules. Change your directory to this project, and then enter the following into the terminal:

```
	npm install
	npm install -g bower
	bower install
```

In order to build the assets and host the files, enter `npm start` in the console, and go to `localhost:3000`.
